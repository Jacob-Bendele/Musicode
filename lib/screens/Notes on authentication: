Notes on authentication:
Nothing is stored in the databasee that states whether a person is authenticated.
Once a user is logge in the server generates a token. Store it on the device.
We send this token with a request such that the API is protected. Only if yyouu have a valid token
will the server allow yyou to send a request.

We will implement this in this module. Nodejs the complete guide source is a good start point.
