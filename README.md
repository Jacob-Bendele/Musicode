# Musicode
## About
Musicode is for the thrift store and record shop music hunter. It is an application that can scan a UPC barcode on a CD, Vinyl Record, or other musical medium. After scanning the album a Spotify link is generated to go directly to the album's page. The idea for Musicode came about when browsing through the huge libraries of CDs and records that end up in thrift stores, curious about how each one sounds.
